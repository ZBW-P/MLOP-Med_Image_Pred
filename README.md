## Title of project

Our group is devoted to developing a hybrid machine learning system that integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) for disease classification with a Large Language Model (LLM) for interpretability and actionable insights. In many clinical settings today, diagnoses from medical images such as chest X-rays are performed manually by radiologists—a process that is time-consuming, subjective, and inconsistent.

By automating the initial classification, our system leverages the ViT to analyze medical images and produce output scores that reflect the likelihood of various diseases. The LLM then interprets these scores by comparing them against established benchmarks, providing patients with an early, preliminary understanding of their condition—indicating whether their situation is mild or severe—and offering insights into what they may face.

Moreover, this approach serves as an effective first-line screening tool for physicians. Doctors can use the system’s preliminary assessments to determine if more detailed examinations are necessary, which helps reduce misdiagnosis and improves overall diagnostic accuracy. This, in turn, enhances treatment efficiency and optimizes hospital workflows.

Our system's success will be evaluated based on improved diagnostic metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) as well as reduced time-to-decision in clinical workflows.
