### Model Training & Training Platforms

#### Problem Setup & Model Motivation

This project addresses the challenge of classifying nine distinct lung disease categories (e.g., lung-covid, lung-oct-cnv, lung-oct-drusen, lung-opacity, lung-viral-pneumonia, etc.) from chest X-ray and OCT images. Early and accurate detection of these conditions is critical for patient care, but traditional convolutional neural networks can struggle to capture small, localized lesions and to model global lung anatomy.

#### Why Vision Transformers?

- **Global Self-Attention.** Each patch can attend to every other patch, enabling the model to learn long-range dependencies (e.g., linking an opacity in the lower lobe to pleural changes elsewhere).  
- **Adaptive Feature Weighting.** Transformer layers dynamically re-weight contributions from different regions, which helps when disease signs vary in size, shape, and location.  
- **Scalability.** ViT scales efficiently with data and model size: fine-tuning on our 5 GB training set often yields richer representations than fixed-receptive-field CNNs.  
- **Medical Imaging State-of-the-Art.** Properly pre-trained and fine-tuned ViTs match or exceed CNN performance on chest X-ray tasks.

#### Our Custom ViT Architecture

- **Convolutional Stem.**  
  - Three 3×3 Conv → BN → ReLU blocks, followed by two stride-2 convs, downsampling the input by 4× in each spatial dimension.  
  - Preserves local edge and texture features, while reducing sequence length (and quadratic attention cost) by ≈16×.  
- **Patch Embedding.**  
  - Flatten the \(C \times \frac{H}{4} \times \frac{W}{4}\) feature map into \(\frac{H}{4} \times \frac{W}{4}\) tokens, each projected to a \(D\)-dimensional embedding.  
  - Learnable positional embeddings and a **[CLS]** token for global classification.  
- **Transformer Backbone.**  
  - **Depth:** `depth` layers; **Heads:** `heads`; **MLP dim:** `mlp_dim`.  
  - Pre-LayerNorm + residual connections for stable training.  
  - Feed-forward MLP with dropout for regularization.  
- **Classification Head.**  
  - LayerNorm → Linear(\(D\), number_of_classes).  
- **Model Footprint.**  
  - ~5 M parameters, ~50 MB `.pth` file.

#### Training Strategy & Experiment Tracking

- **Data Splits.** 5 GB train / 2 GB val / 1 GB test.  
- **Distributed Data-Parallel (DDP).**  
  - Multi-GPU gradient averaging yields near-linear speedups and smoother loss curves.  
  - Larger effective batch size stabilizes training and often improves accuracy.  
- **MLflow Logging.**  
  - Track per-epoch metrics (accuracy, loss, class-wise precision/recall).  
  - Log GPU utilization and learning-rate schedules.  
  - Artifact versioning of model checkpoints and hyperparameters for reproducibility.  
- **Ray Train.**  
  - Uses `RayDDPStrategy` to scale Lightning training seamlessly across a Ray cluster.  
  - Autoscaling of CPU/GPU resources and dynamic task scheduling for efficient utilization.  
  - Fault-tolerant execution with automatic recovery from worker node failures.
